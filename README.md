# Autonomous Object Detection Robot using EIT

Welcome to the **Autonomous Object Detection Robot** project repository! This project aims to develop a robotic system capable of detecting buried objects within soil using **Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)** technology. The robot will autonomously navigate within a predefined area, detect objects buried up to 50 mm deep, and provide real-time feedback on their positions.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the following key components:

- **Localization:** Utilizing **Raspberry Pi** for accurate localization of the robot within the predefined area.
- **Object Detection:** Employing **EIT technology with a custom ESP32 board** for detecting objects buried within the soil.
- **Control System:** Implementing motor control using **Raspberry Pi** and sensor integration using the custom **ESP32 board**.
- **User Interface:** Developing a graphical user interface (**GUI**) for real-time visualization of detected objects and robot localization data.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot autonomously navigates within the predefined area, avoiding obstacles and detecting buried objects.
- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Utilizing EIT technology for real-time detection and localization of objects buried within the soil.
- **Accurate Localization:** Achieving accurate localization of the robot using Raspberry Pi, enabling precise movement and object detection.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring the robot's movements, viewing detected objects, and accessing localization data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/ookkshirsagar/ADMM2024.git


2. **Setup Hardware:** Configure the hardware components, including the Raspberry Pi for motor control and localization, the custom ESP32 board for EIT, as per the project documentation.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary software dependencies as specified in the project documentation.

4. **Run the Code:** Run the main script to initialize the robot, start the object detection process, and display real-time data on the user interface.
